# Marriott RFM-Based Customer Lifetime Value Model Project -- by Marrianalytica Tech Team

## Overview

This project develops a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) model for Marriott using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and analysis to segment customers and predict their lifetime value.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries Used
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Setting Up the Project Environment

To access and work with the Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) in this project, follow these straightforward steps:

1. **Download the Notebook Files**: Obtain the `.ipynb` files from the provided source. This could be via a direct download link, email attachment, or any other file transfer method used for your project.

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed in your environment. If it's not already installed, you can do so by running:

   ```bash
   pip install notebook


## File Structure

- `Long Term CLV Calculation & Customer Segmentation Based on CLV.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Long Term CLV & Customer Segmentation.
- `Short-Term_BG-NBD+GG_Example.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the implementation of the Buy 'Til You Die (BG-NBD) and Gamma-Gamma (GG) models.
- `Group_A-Proof-of-Concept.pdf`: Document outlining the project concept and business objectives.
- `All_CLV_Prediction_Models.ipynb`: This notebook encompasses various prediction models to predict 2021 Customer Lifetime Value(CLV).

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize, clean, and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create RFM features based on customer transaction history.
3. **Model Training**: Train regression models to predict customer lifetime value.
4. **Analysis**: Use BG-NBD and GG models for customer segmentation.
5. **Test**: Test the model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
